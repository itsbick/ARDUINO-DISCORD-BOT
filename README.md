<b>Moderator (Discord Bot)<b>
<p>Made in Python using the pyserial and discord modules, this is a simple functional bot that allows you to 
  work/control an Arduino board through a locally run Discord bot on your PC. The Arduino board is connected 
  to a lamp or another device, and you can control it using commands through the bot. It's a smart project 
  that can be crafted simply.</p>
